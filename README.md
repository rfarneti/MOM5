# The Modular Ocean Model

MOM is a numerical ocean model based on the hydrostatic primitive equations. Development of the model is managed through this Github site.

Contributions from users and developers are always welcomed. Any questions should be directed to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mom-users).

To get started with MOM please consult the [quickstart guide](https://mom-ocean.github.io/docs/quick-start-guide/). More information can be found in the [online documentation](https://mom-ocean.github.io/)
